# tic-tac-toe-game
A variant of the game for an arbitrary number of fields

In this repository you can find the python code of the famous **tic-tac-toe game**. A unique feature of my variant is the ability to set any number of the playing field cells (not only the standard three by three).

To run the code, you only need a standard python 3 interpreter. The graphical interface of the game is implemented using the standard built-in Tkinter module, so you don't need to install any third-party libraries.

Just set the value of the constant **FIELD_SIZE** (by default is 4) - and the program will independently form the playing field. Try playing with a bot. No one has managed to defeat my game yet! Try your hand too :)
